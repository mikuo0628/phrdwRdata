# `phrdwRdata`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`phrdwRdata` is a package designed specifically for BCCDC users to
easily pull and query pre-built datasets by abstracting away server
connections, handling data sources, writing specific MDX or SQL queries,
and table joining, etc.

Users can consistently pull data without in-depth domain knowledge
pertaining to specific data sources or flows, nor the need to explore
backend tables first follow by testing and validations.

Users just need to provide simple parameters, such as query dates,
disease name, health regions, and various other built-in filters
specific to each dataset, and be able to proceed with their analyses or
pipeline.

## Installation

The best way to install is via Github. This ensures up-to-date
functionality and bug fixes.

To install from Github, you may require additional packages, such as
`devtools` or `renv`.

``` r
# with devtools
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github(
  'mikuo0628/phrdwRdata',
  dependencies = T
)

# with renv
library(renv)
renv::install(
  'mikuo0628/phrdwRdata',
  rebuild = T,
  dependencies = T,
  prompt = F
)
```

Installation from Gitlab will be available soon.

Alternatively, you can install from a pre-compiled tarball that could be
found on the network drive. Although this may not guarantee newest
version. Users should take note of the version number in the file name.

``` r
install.packages(
  file.path(
    "O:/BCCDC/Groups/Analytics_Resources/Coding",
    "Git_Repository/phrdwRdata_1.0.0.tar.gz" # version number may be different
  ),
  # if installation runs into issue with test load
  # INSTALL_opts = '--no-test-load', 
  repos = NULL
)
```

## Usages

All legacy functionality is retained. Please read `vignette('Legacy')`.

### Whatâ€™s new?

- `phrdwRdata` can be used outside the Microsoft R client (ver 3.5.2),
  in newer R versions, and does not require `olapR`.

- Installation of this package is available and preferred, as opposed to
  side-loading a pre-compiled version stored on the network drive, which
  can lead to unexpected issues.

- Datasets retrieved from SQL now leverages
  [`dbplyr`](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/).

- Datasets retrieved from SQL are pre-optimized by performing `WHERE` on
  the joining tables first before `JOIN`. This improves performance on
  the initial call (ie. before internal caching).

  ``` r
  # Legacy
  system.time(
    phrdwRdata::get_phrdw_data(
      phrdw_datamart_connection = connect_to_phrdw('CD Mart'),
      phrdw_datamart            = 'CD Mart',
      dataset_name              = 'Investigation',
      query_start_date          = '2021-01-01',
      query_end_date            = '2022-01-01'
    )
  )

  # Stable
  system.time(
    phrdwRdata::get_phrdw_data(
      mart             = 'CD',
      dataset_name     = 'Investigation',
      query_start_date = '2021-01-01',
      query_end_date   = '2022-01-01'
    )
  )
  ```

      # Legacy
      user  system elapsed 
      1.27    0.42   22.06 

      # Stable
      user  system elapsed 
      1.54    0.45   10.09 

- There is also an experimental `common table expression` (CTE)
  parameter which will attempt to execute SQL queries as CTEs using
  `WITH` instead as subqueries.

- Using the function is now more streamlined with less repetition.

  - No need to establish connection first.
  - No need to repeat `phrdw_datamart`.

``` r
# Legacy
phrdwRdata::get_phrdw_data(
  phrdw_datamart_connection = connect_to_phrdw('CD Mart'),
  phrdw_datamart            = 'CD Mart',
  dataset_name              = 'Investigation',
  query_start_date          = '2021-01-01',
  query_end_date            = '2022-01-01'
)

# Stable
phrdwRdata::get_phrdw_data(
  mart             = 'CD',
  dataset_name     = 'Investigation',
  query_start_date = '2021-01-01',
  query_end_date   = '2022-01-01'
)
```

- More forgiving user inputs.

  - Not case-sensitive.

  ``` r
  phrdwRdata::get_phrdw_data(
    mart             = 'cd', 
    dataset_name     = 'investigation',
    query_start_date = '2021-01-01',
    query_end_date   = '2022-01-01'
  )
  ```

  - Dates can be character strings, and handles open bounds gracefully.

- Troubleshooting messages and tools.

  - Meaningful error messages for users to troubleshoot.

  ``` r
  phrdwRdata::get_phrdw_data(
    mart             = 'xyz', 
    dataset_name     = 'investigation',
    query_start_date = '2021-01-01',
    query_end_date   = '2022-01-01'
  )
  ```

      Error: Please check argument `mart` spelling.
      It should be one of the following (non case-sensitive):

        - CD
        - CDI
        - Enteric
        - Respiratory
        - STIBBI
        - TAT
        - VPD

  ``` r
  phrdwRdata::get_phrdw_data(
    mart             = 'cd', 
    dataset_name     = 'investigations',
    query_start_date = '2021-01-01',
    query_end_date   = '2022-01-01'
  )
  ```

      Error: Please check `dataset_name` spelling.
      It should be one of the following (case-sensitive if legacy):

        - Investigation
        - Client
        - Risk Factor
        - Symptom
        - Observation
        - UDF
        - Lab
        - Transmission Events
        - Contacts
        - Outbreaks
        - Complication
        - TB Contacts
        - TB Investigation
        - TB Transmission Events
        - TB Client
        - TB TST Investigation
        - TB TST Client
        - TB Lab

  - Return query instead of data.
  - Examine dataset metadata.

- Beyond the default built-in filters: users can leverage metadata info
  and dynamic dots to query with additional filters. See Examples in
  [phrdwRdata::get_phrdw_data()](https://mikuo0628.github.io/phrdwRdata/reference/get_phrdw_data.html).
